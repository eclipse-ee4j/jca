/** The <code>javax.resource.cci.Record</code> interface is the base 
 *  interface for the representation of an input or output to the 
 *  execute methods defined on an Interaction.
 *  
 *  <p>The Record interface can be extended to form a one of the 
 *  following representations:
 *  <UL>
 *     <LI> MappedRecord: A key-value pair based collection represents
 *          a record. This interface is based on the <code>java.util.Map</code>
 *     <LI> IndexedRecord:An ordered and indexed collection represents 
 *          a record. This interface is based on the <code>java.util.List</code>.
 *     <LI> JavaBean based representation of an EIS abstraction: An 
 *          example is a custom record generated to represent a purchase 
 *          order in an ERP system.
 *     <LI> <code>javax.resource.cci.ResultSet</code>: This interface 
 *          extends both <code>java.sql.ResultSet</code> and <code>
 *          javax.resource.cci.Record</code>. A ResultSet
 *          represents tabular data.
 *  </UL> 
 *
 *  <p>A MappedRecord or IndexedRecord can contain another Record. This 
 *  means that MappedRecord and IndexedRecord can be used to create 
 *  a hierarchical structure of any arbitrary depth. A basic Java 
 *  type is used as the leaf element of a hierarchical structure 
 *  represented by a MappedRecord or IndexedRecord.
