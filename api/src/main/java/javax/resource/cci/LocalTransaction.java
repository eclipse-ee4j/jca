/** The LocalTransaction defines a transaction demarcation interface for
 *  resource manager local transactions. Note that this interface is 
 *  used for application level local transaction demarcation. The
 *  system contract level LocalTransaction interface (as defined in
 *  the <code>javax.resource.spi</code> package) is used by the container 
 *  for local transaction management.
 *
 *  <p>A local transaction is managed internal to a resource manager. There
 *  is no external transaction manager involved in the coordination of 
 *  such transactions.
 *
 *  <p>A CCI implementation can (but is not required to) implement the
 *  LocalTransaction interface. If the LocalTransaction interface is supported
 *  by a CCI implementation, then the method 
 *  <code>Connection.getLocalTransaction</code> should return a
 *  LocalTransaction instance. A component can then use the
 *  returned LocalTransaction to demarcate a resource manager local transaction
 *  (associated with the Connection instance) on the underlying EIS 
 *  instance.
