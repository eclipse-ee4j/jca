/** LocalTransaction interface provides support for transactions that

 *  <p>A resource adapter implements the javax.resource.spi.LocalTransaction 
 *  interface to provide support for local transactions that are performed
 *  on the underlying resource manager.
 *
 *  <p>If a resource adapter supports the LocalTransaction interface, then 
 *  the application server can choose to perform local transaction 
 *  optimization (uses local transaction instead of a JTA transaction for
 *  a single resource manager case).
